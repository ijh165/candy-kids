The "Pre-Assignment" folder contains the code and Makefile for the Measuring Context Switch Costs Pre-Assignment as well as the pdf Time.pdf which documents all the timing measurements.
-MCSC1.c is code for the #1 pre assignment
-MCSC2.c is code for the #2 pre assignment
-MCSC3.c is code for the #3 pre assignment
-MCSC4.c is code for the #4 pre assignment
PS: If you want to try the timing yourself run the commands "make MCSC1", "make MCSC2", "make MCSC3", or "make MCSC4" and run the respective executables.

The "src" folder contains the source code and Makefile for the solution to the Candy Kids problem.
